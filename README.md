### Performance Metrics

- **Chunk Size**: 1MB (1,048,576 bytes)
- **Buffer Size**: 4KB (4,096 bytes) for network operations
- **Concurrent Clients**: Limited by system resources (tested up to 10 simultaneous)
- **Transfer Speed**: Dependent on network conditions (local testing shows ~50MB/s)

## Performance Considerations

### Network Efficiency
- **Chunking Strategy**: 1MB chunks balance memory usage and transfer efficiency
- **Buffer Management**: 4KB buffers optimize network I/O
- **Protocol Overhead**: Minimal JSON overhead for control messages

### Scalability
- **Threading Model**: Each client handled in separate thread
- **Memory Usage**: Chunked reading prevents large files from consuming excessive memory
- **Connection Pooling**: Server maintains connection state efficiently

### Error Handling
- **Network Failures**: Graceful handling of disconnections
- **File Errors**: Proper error messages for missing files
- **Protocol Errors**: Validation of message formats

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Security Features**
   - Authentication and authorization
   - SSL/TLS encryption
   - File integrity verification (checksums)

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Parallel chunk transfer
   - Compression for text files
   - Resume capability for interrupted transfers

3. **User Experience**
   - GUI interface using tkinter or PyQt
   - Drag-and-drop file selection
   - Transfer history and logging

4. **Advanced Features**
   - Bidirectional file transfer (upload capability)
   - Directory synchronization
   - Bandwidth throttling

### Code Quality Improvements

1. **Configuration Management**
   - External configuration files
   - Command-line argument parsing
   - Environment variable support

2. **Logging System**
   - Structured logging with levels
   - Log file rotation
   - Performance metrics logging

3. **Testing Framework**
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests for client-server communication
